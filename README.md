# HouseBot
A lil bot for da house. Uses some features and code from [Big Boi Bot](https://github.com/TheGrimlessReaper/BigBoiBot), my other miscellaneous Discord bot.

## Extra Files
Similarly to [Big Boi Bot](https://github.com/TheGrimlessReaper/BigBoiBot), in order for House Bot to run, you need to put the proper info into a configu.txt file in the same directory as the Python script file (sample file for which you can fill in the blanks provided), put your bot token in a token.txt file in the same directory as the Python script file, and likewise with the Google Maps API Key in a mapskey.txt file. Also needs an empty reminders.json file. Replace the paths where Python reads the txt and json files with your own.
